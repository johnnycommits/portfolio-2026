    At <strong>Adcetera Design Group</strong>, I was entrusted—just one month after joining the studio—with leading the
    largest and most complex project to date: a multi-million-dollar, four-month rebuild of <strong>KBR</strong>’s global
    website. This responsibility was awarded after I quickly demonstrated technical and leadership capability by
    contributing to Adcetera’s own rebranded website.

    I led a delivery team of two junior front-end engineers while working in close partnership with a backend engineer.
    I owned technical direction and execution, mentored and unblocked junior developers, and ensured the team stayed
    aligned on scope, quality, and timelines throughout the engagement.

    A core contribution was the design and implementation of a flexible, component-based system of reusable content
    blocks within Drupal. This empowered KBR’s internal teams to independently manage and scale content across the site
    without developer involvement. I worked closely with backend engineering to ensure seamless CMS integration,
    performance, and long-term maintainability.

    Accessibility was a major focus of the project. I helped drive and implement compliance with
    <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA</strong> standards across the site, ensuring inclusive experiences through proper semantic
    markup, keyboard navigation, contrast requirements, and accessible component patterns suitable for a global
    enterprise audience.

    The project also included a custom Google Maps integration to visualize KBR’s worldwide footprint, supporting a
    broader brand repositioning from an oil-and-gas services company to a world-class technology leader.

    The award-nominated site increased users year-over-year by <strong>12% within six months of launch</strong>, while
    boosting <strong>average time on site by 15%</strong>. The work went on to win a <strong>Gold ADDY Award</strong>
    from the <strong>American Advertising Federation (AAF) Houston</strong>, in a highly competitive year against
    several of Houston’s top agencies, recognizing the project as <strong>Best B2B Enterprise Website</strong>.
