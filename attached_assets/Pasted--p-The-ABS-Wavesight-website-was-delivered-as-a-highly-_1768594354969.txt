    The ABS Wavesight website was delivered as a highly collaborative, cross-disciplinary effort involving Client
    Services, UX/UI Design, Motion, Copywriting, and Engineering. ABS Wavesight provides advanced risk and performance
    analytics for the maritime and offshore industries, requiring a digital experience that balanced technical
    credibility with a modern, data-driven brand presence.

    Serving as one of two front-end co-leads on the project, I partnered closely with my counterpart to divide and own
    front-end responsibilities end-to-end. I worked directly with UX and UI teams to translate complex client needs and
    design intent into scalable, production-ready solutions.

    In addition to hands-on development, I supported sprint planning, helped define levels of effort for front-end
    tasks, and collaborated with project leadership to ensure scope, timelines, and technical constraints remained
    aligned throughout the build.

    Using Drupal with Acquia Site Studio, I helped architect and implement a flexible, custom authoring experience that
    empowered content creators with fine-grained control over layout, spacing, color themes, animations, and component
    variations. The system included built-in authoring guidance to reduce errors, improve consistency, and streamline
    the content creation workflow.

    A key technical challenge involved adding full support for right-to-left (RTL) languages, including Arabic.
    This required careful coordination with design and motion teams to adapt ABS Wavesight’s distinctive angular
    visual language for RTL layouts without breaking visual hierarchy, animations, or component logic.

    The final site features rich motion and interactivity, including custom-scripted animations and Lottie-based
    components designed to enhance storytelling while maintaining performance and accessibility standards suitable
    for an enterprise audience.
