Texas Grid Status is a lightweight, public-facing dashboard that provides a clear, user-friendly snapshot of Texas power grid conditions using ERCOT’s public data. The goal of the project was to make it easier for everyday Texans to quickly understand how the grid is performing, especially during severe weather, without needing to interpret dense charts or industry-specific jargon.

I began the project in Figma Make, using prompt-based design to rapidly explore and iterate on multiple UI directions. By treating design as a conversational process rather than a static deliverable, I was able to refine the layout, hierarchy, and visual language quickly until the interface felt calm, readable, and mobile-first.

Once the design was finalized, I used Figma MCP to export the design context via URL and pasted it directly into Cursor, where I leveraged Claude’s Sonnet 4.5 model to generate the initial UI implementation. This workflow allowed me to translate design intent into working code with minimal friction, while still maintaining full control over structure, styling, and accessibility.

On the engineering side, I researched and integrated multiple ERCOT public API endpoints, including supply and demand data as well as Physical Responsive Capability (PRC) metrics. This required carefully understanding how ERCOT structures and updates its data, distinguishing between real-time and forecasted values, and determining which metrics best represented grid health in a way that was both accurate and easy to explain to non-technical users.

Using that understanding, I again prompted Cursor to help build a small Next.js backend API route that queries ERCOT’s endpoints, normalizes the data, and caches responses to prevent unnecessary upstream load. This backend layer ensures reliable performance even during traffic spikes, while keeping the frontend logic clean and focused on presentation.

The project was deployed on Vercel, taking advantage of its serverless infrastructure, caching, and analytics. After launch, I shared the site organically on Reddit during a Texas weather event. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with over 60 supportive comments from the community praising the clarity, design, and usefulness of the interface. Several users even reported embedding the dashboard into their Home Assistant setups, validating the project’s utility beyond its original scope.

Overall, this project demonstrates an end-to-end, AI-accelerated product workflow: from prompt-driven design and MCP-enabled UI generation, through thoughtful API integration and system design, to real-world deployment and community adoption.
